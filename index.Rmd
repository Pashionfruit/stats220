## My meme

My motivation for my meme was a typical meme format of a reaction image and some text - I made it original by adding Pikachu! (I don't tend to see many memes with Pikachu in it, apart from the very popular "Shocked Pikachu" meme.) I thought it would be nice to fill the pikachu sized hole in the meme community :)

## my animation

This is my animation! I don't believe I copied it off of any specific template (but I could be wrong - such is the work of subliminal messaging or something. Subliminal meme-ing? Not quite sure that's right lol). "Running away from problems" does seem to be a meme-like saying, so I went with it (especially because it's such a cute pikachu running animation in the first place!).  I wanted to add more ~~creativity~~, so I flipped the gif (in more ways than one).
